# First Contributions

It's hard. It's always hard the first time you do something. Especially when you are collaborating, making mistakes isn't a comfortable thing. But open source is all about collaboration & working together. We wanted to simplify the way new open-source contributors learn & contribute for the first time.

Reading articles & watching tutorials can help, but what comes better than actually doing the stuff without messing up anything. This project aims at providing guidance & simplifying the way rookies make their first contribution. Remember the more relaxed you are the better you learn. If you are looking for making your first contribution just follow the simple steps below. We promise you, it will be fun.

It is possible to do all repository work online in the GitHub website using the GitHub web editing tools along with file upload tools from your local files which may have your own preferred folder and versioning system with GitHub online as your one stop shop for putting a project together. This tutorial follows the GitHub-website-entered approach.
